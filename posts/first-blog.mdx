## Venturing into the Open Source community - My first blog.

Hi there! I'm so excited to publish my first post ever and engage with the Hashnode community.

I'm a self-taught and aspiring frontend web developer. I've been learning how to write code for
about 2 years now but something has been amiss during all that learning period. I realized that the
reason why I wasn't growing as a a developer was because I never shared my thoughts and ideas with
the community therefore I was missing out on the positive criticism that would shape my logic as a
programmer.

In this blog I'll be sharing what I've learnt so far in frontend development

Some of the topics I want to share with the community include (but not limited to):

-   Working with color programmatically using JavaScript.
-   Creating generative art with JavaScript and SVG. -Opinions about my stack (tools I use).
-   And some of the wacky concepts that have cropped in my mind time and again!

Being a newbie in the open source community I hope to engage with programmers from all spectrums as
well as share ideas and learn from those that have travelled the road before me. More importantly, I
aim to increase my contribution to open source so that the community can benefit as much as I have
and make information accessible to developers in areas underrepresented in tech.

I hope to build acquantances through the sharing of ideas and would love to have your feedback in
the comment section.

Till next time!
