Where elements are placed in a user interface is one of the simplest ways to define your visual
hierarchy. For example in cultures that read from left to right (English for instance) elements that
are placed at the top left are deemed to be of higher priority.

According to Fitt's Law areas with an easier reach such as the corners or borders of the screen
because they're easier to navigate to since basically what you have to do is "throw" the cursor to
the edges instead of centering on an element in the centre of the screen.

Laying out elements in a straight line (in rows or columns) creates a sense of momentum as the eye
scans the content which is ideal for calls to action. However a balance has to be struck between
giving your users a lot of options and restricting their choices to only the essentials. because
according to Hick's Law "The more decisions a person has the longer the decision making process.
This is also known as choice paralysis.

Failure to achieve such a balance will simply flatten out your UI because it will be cluttered
therefore nothing will stand out.

### How to achieve visual hierarchy using layout

-   Choosing a single focal point

Designing around your most important element will allow you to organize other elements around it
therefore enhancing its importance and it will also make laying out the content easier

-   Use a grid

Grids allow us to create balanced layouts keeping all the elements well aligned throughout the
simplest

-   Take advantage of user sight patterns

The consumption paradigm will be heavily reliant on user sight patterns. For instance text heavy
sites might make use of the F reading pattern
