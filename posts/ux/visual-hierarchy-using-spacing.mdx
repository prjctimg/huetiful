#### Applying visual hierarchy using space

Spacing between elements can help establish or break the relationship between them. It impacts the
hierarchy in two ways proximity and negative space.

#### proximity

Based from the Gestalt Principles. proximity allows users to perceive elements placed together as
having similar functions.

For example when a group of icons are laid out they're perceived as being a way to interact with the
content above

#### negative space

Also known as white space, it gives the content breathing space making the UI feel less cluttered.
It is mostly taken advantage of in minimalistic designs where the goal is too reduce visual noise in
the UI and emphasizing the priority of content.

#### How to apply it

-   Use variety

Changing the distribution of whitespace helps us visually group elements and their function
determined by the distance from each other. Experiment with symmetry and balance

-   Take advantage of grouping properties

Grouping elements together suggests similarity thus can make the system feel intuitive much quicker.
Be mindful of spacing between groups of elements and between multiple elements.

For example elements that allow users to do a specific task ie Inviting new users are all closely
grouped.

-   Limit elements per page

This means avoiding clutter. The spacing between elements should help establish a sense of
hierarchy.

-   Dont overdo it Theres a thin line between minimalism and dullness. This means that too much
    whitespace will mean your site lacks interesting content
