## Creating balanced color palettes using JavaScript.

This idea was inspired by a post by George Francis. You can read the original article here.

Commonly designers have worked with color in graphic design using RGB,HSL and HSV. Though they are
better color spaces such as LCH or OKLCH which is perceptually uniform these color spaces are not
yet supported by browsers.

In this post we're going to build a simple palette generator that make picking colors in yur
projects easier and more creative.

I will be working with two libraries to demonstrate how the same functionqality can be achieved with
each. Depending on your taste you are free to choose the approach that feels easier and customizable
for you. I will be working with Chroma-js and Culori which are open source JavaScript libraries for
perfoming color computations

The function will take a color value. It will convert the color value to a color space thats
perceptually uniform. The color computions are done in that color space. The resulting colors are
returned in a CSS compatible color format.

### Prerequisities:

An understanding of basic JavaScript will be enough to understand and (optionally), an idea in color
theory will make it easier to understand the reasoning behind the code.

### Objective:

By the end of this post we should have a palette generator that can output different palette
schemes.

#### How does it work

The function takes input as a color value. The color value passed to the function is converted to a
color space that produces perceptually uniform colors. Depending on the color space used you can
apply optional ranges for the computations The function returns a map with different color-schemes
with the palette name as key and an array of hex codes as values. For each color in the array a
tonal palette is generated as per Material Design Guidelines.

##### Application

Generating color palettes with code can give us fine control over the colors we want to use as well
as offer us infinite choices when we,re experimenting with designs.

Coupled with some custom CSS properties we can use this function to test out the colors for our
designs.

Below is an example of using the createPalettes function to find the best set of colors suited for
the role.

##### Making the colors nicer

We can optionally apply a constraint to the chroma/saturation of our colors so that we get colors
that are harmonized in our palettes
