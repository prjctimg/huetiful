### Working with CIELAB color space using JavaScript.

#### Learn how to use Lab and LCH to fine tune the color palettes in your design.

The CIELAB color space was intended to be perceptually umniform, that is to say that the way colors
transition into each other should match as expected by the human vision.

It is based on the opponent color model of human vision where red and green form an oppent pair and
blue and yellow form an opponent pair.

Often shortened as L*a*b\*b, each letter represents a channel

-   L

For perceptual lightness

-   \*a

Represents the red and green opponent pair. Negative values map to green while positive values map
to red.

-   \*b

Represents the blue and yellow opponent pair.Negative values map to blue while positive values map
to yellow.

However due to technicalities such as some of the colors not being reproducible in RGB monitors the
majority of the colors are clipped because they're not mapped on the RGB cube
