### Creating beautiful gradients using custom interpolations and the LAB color space.

####### Learn how to design harmonious gradients using JavaScript based custom interpolation
functions and balanced color spaces.

Gradients have been a long time favourite for designers. They're so versatile and with careful use
can push the brand message better to the users. The problem starts when we have to pick the best
colors. Its either the colors "don't feel right" or balancing the saturation is frustrating.

In this post we're going to explore some of the handy functions I've come across the Internet. If
you love working with CSS gradients, you're at the right place.

#### A quick overview of the important terms

##### What is interpolation?

In the case of color, interpolating means tracing a line through the coordinates of these colors,
and figuring out what colors reside on the line at various positions.

### Example of interpolation goes here

#### The CIELab color space

#### Why the Lab color space ?

Interpolation in the RGB color space sometimes produces grayish colors and the center of the
interpolated tends to get darker. Linear RGB interpolation can give better results.

LAB interpolation produces better results because it is perceptually uniform. However support for
Lab is not yet in browsers so we'll only use this color space to perfom the computations and the
convert the end results to a CSS compatible color format like hex codes.

#### Approach

Our function will take an array of colors to interpolate, a mode param to specify the color space to
perform the computations in as args. We will be using Culori to do the dirty work of handling the
color conversions and manipulations.

```import

```
