2. Yes. Zimbabwe is underrepresented in the tech industry due to certain political reasons limiting
   tech companies from engaging with our country. For instance cryptocurrency was banned in Zimbabwe
   which caused ventures such as ZimboCash and Skrill to withdraw their services. This makes it
   difficult for the average programmer to get the full benefits of the latest technologies. From a
   socio-economic point of view I am underrepresented because I am unable to fund my education
   further because of financial constraints. I am currently earnig $5 a day working from Monday to
   Friday as a general hand (I earn $100/month). This isnt much considering that the cost of a
   monthly data package is $15 for 10GB! This limits how often I get to have access to a stable
   internet connection.

3. I have not yet applied for a job position in any firm due to the systemic bias of the method used
   to select employees in firms in my country. One is required to have a strong background in
   Mathematics and Computer Science in order for them to apply for the job. This usually includes a
   degree in Computer Science or any other documentation that is relevant to the post one is
   applying for. This makes it difficult for someone who's self taught (like me) to get an
   opportunity to work in a company environment. My highest education level is a ZIMSEC Advanced
   Level Certificate making It hard to convince the interviewers to consider your skills if you fail
   to produce plausible documentation. In 2021, vacancies opened up at Econet Wireless but I
   couldn't apply for a position because I had not done Computer Science at university (which was
   actually the minimum requirement).

4. Yes. As a matter of fact I have a close colleague of mine and he joined me in my pursuit of
   teaching ourselves how to write software. His name , Rashid shares the same level of education as
   me but he had the advantage of having done Computer Science at A level but he didn't manage to
   sit for his examination because of personal matters. However, that has not stopped us from
   socialising with people who had access to information about our ambition. Shepherd Jasento, a
   Computer Science graduate who lives nearby was one of the first people to motivate me to teach
   myself programming irregardless of the factors I considered limiting factors. He gave me all the
   software I needed to setup a development environment forlearning web development. He also
   introduced me to the concept behind open source software which gives everyone access to useful
   software free of charge and how it was the basis of Open Web Technologies.

5. I have faced many challenges throughout my journey as a self taught and aspiring programmer.
   Service restrictions due to my region are a limiting factor in the roadmap of developers in
   Zimbabwe. For example, I could not purchase a domain on Google Domains because my country is not
   yet supported. More recently,the release of ChatGPT has raised the stakes for programming because
   the AI is a useful research tool when developing software. Unfortunately this "open source"
   project is not available in Zimbabwe. This is a major disadvantage because it means there is no
   access to the latest technology in my field which puts me at a disadvantage because im no longer
   in sync with the current trend. Usually, these technologies become available to my country after
   they have already been exploited which means that as a country our developers are years behind in
   technological advancements.
