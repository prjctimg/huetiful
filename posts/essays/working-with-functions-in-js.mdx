#### Why functions ?

Functions allow us to encapsulate reusable pieces of code. This means that instead of writing the
code for a specific task over and over again we can just store the procedures in a function and then
call that function whenever we need to use those steps again. In short they help keep our code DRY
(Don't repeat yourself).

```
//This is how we define a simple function in JavaScript
function addSum(a,b){
    // Any code that you want to use
    return a+b;
}
```

#### Working with function parameters

Also known as arguments, parameters are wrapped around in parentheses () and they are how we pass
input to a function. The arguments are passed down to any code that requests them within the
function.

Using a parameter that is not defined in the parentheses or a variable not declared within an
accesible scope will throw an error:

```
function addSum(a,b){
    return a+b+c
}

// Throws a reference error:c is not defined
addSum(2,2)
```

#### Function currying

Currying allows us to create highly reusable functions by splitting the arguments to unary functions
(a function that takes one argument)

This is useful when we have a function that takes many arguments and passing all the arguments at
one goal may not be effecient.

Currying involves wrapping the function in a higher order function and returning a unary function
for each parameter with the last parameter being passed to a function that resolves the value of all
the arguments.
