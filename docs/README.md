TypeScript library for general purpose color manipulations and generating custom color scales.

## Getting started⛳

### Node

You can use a CDN in this example, jsdelivr to load the library remotely:

```js
import {...} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/huetiful-js/lib/huetiful.esm.mjs'

```

### Browser

Or load the library as a UMD glabal (`huetiful`) in your HTML file using a `<script>` tag:

```html
# With script tag

<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/huetiful-js/dist/huetiful.umd.js'></script>
```
