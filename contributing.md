# Contributing 💙

Thank you :smile: for contributing to [huetiful-js](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful)!

On this page you'll find information on how to setup the project and navigate the file structure.

The project structure is as follows:

- `www/` - Where the documentation site lives
- `lib/` - This is where the source code is located
- `tests/`  This is where the test  files for the publicly accessible symbols live.

## Requirements

- Supported version of Node (LTS or higher)
- git
- bun (for building bundles)
- deno (for tests)

## Setup⛳

To quickly get the development environment ready you can run  the following command, you can replace `npm` with any package manager :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful && cd huetiful 

# Package manager of your choice
bun install
```

## Documentation

The API documentation is written as  JSDoc comments and is compiled from the source files using [TypeDoc][typedoc] and  [typedoc-plugin-markdown][markdown-plugin].

The site is generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) which gets its markdown source from Typedoc using the typedoc-plugin-markdown

You can edit the other pages by going to the `www/docs/` directory.

## Adding/Running tests  🧪

```sh
bun test

```

Each module with publicly exported symbols has a corresponding `*.test.ts` file. The specs are defined as an object with the following structure:

```ts
export type Spec = {
  description?: string;
  callback: any;
  params: any[];
};
```

Note that none of the field is optional
