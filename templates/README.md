# Documentation theme built with Tailwind CSS

This is a pure HTML and Tailwind CSS documentation template. As it uses no other dependency than Tailwind CSS, it’s plug and play with any static site generator.

This theme comes with two views/layouts:

- index view; perfect for quick links to important docs
- show view; where the regular docs live

## Other features

- Fully responsive, inc. navigation
- Previous/next articles navigation
- Fallback search using DuckDuckGo (when no JavaScript is present)
