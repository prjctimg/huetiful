# Collection

Functional programming favours batch operations on iterable objects such as arrays or any keyed colllections of data. Taking this approach we can perform collection based methods on collections using controlling factors (such as hue or lightness) to determine our output. 

Current color manipulation libraries focus on manipulating an individual color token in most cases. This module takes this approach a step further by exposing utilities for performing collection based methods on collections of color tokens. 

Some of the utilities exposed by this module provide functionality for:
- Sorting collections of colors in place
- Filtering collwctions of colors using quantifiable factors of the color tokens as the filtering criteria.
- Distributing target channel values of color tokens across collections.
- Quantifying factors of statistical significance from collections.

Working with collections of colore tokens allows us to create flexible designs in our algorithmic artworks. For example we can filter out colors that are not within the expected hue ranges and relative contrast.

Honestly speaking, the use cases of this module are only limited by the creativity of anyone who may use this module.
