[User research studies ](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/how-accessible-design-helps-everyone/) have shown that a significant percentage of users have some form of disability which ultimately affects how they interact with a product. 

Color is important in visual design because it allows us to communicate with our audience without using words. For example, a red button is commonly used to indicate that the action is potentially destructive. However, certain users with some form of visual impairment can have a hard time telling certain hues apart which effectively renders color as an inadequate medium to communicate intent with. Fortunately, they're some workarounds that can help make color more accessible.

This module tries to handle color related accessibility issues such as:
- Contrast
- Color vision deficiency
- Adaptive palettes
