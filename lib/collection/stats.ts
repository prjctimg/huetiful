/**
 *
 * Computes statistical values about the specified `factor(s)` from the passedin collection.
 *
 * The properties from each returned `factor` object are:
 *
 * * `against` - The color being used for comparison. Required for the `distance` and `contrast` factors.
 * If `relativeMean` is `false`, other factors that take the comparison color token as an overload (`contrast | distance`) will have this property's value as `null`.
 * * `colorspace` - The colorspace in which the `factors` were computed in. It has no effect on the `contrast` or `distance` factors (for now).
 *
 * * `extremums` - An array of the minimum and the maximum value (respectively) of the `factor`.
 * * `colors` - An array of color tokens that have the minimum and maximum `extremum` values respectively.
 * * `mean` - The average value for the `factor`.
 *
 * The `mean` property can be overloaded by the `relativeMean` option:
 *
 * * If `relativeMean` is `true`, the `against` option will be used as a subtrahend for calculating the distance between each `extremum`.
 * For example, it will mean "Get the largest/smallest distance between `factor` as compared `against` this color token otherwise just get the smallest/largest `factor` from the passed in collection."
 *
 *
 * These properties are available at the topmost level of the resultant object:
 *
 * * `achromatic` - The amount of colors which are gray out of the total colors in the collection as a value in the range [0,1].
 * * `colorspace` - The colorspace in which the values were computed from, expected to be hue based.
 * Defaults to `lch` if an invalid mode like `rgb` is used.
 *
 *
 * * The `factor` is expected to be an array of strings with each element being a valid `factor`. Every key is a `factor`, with the stats of that `factor` as the value in the result object.
 *
 * To get all the factors in the result object pass `undefined` to `factor`.
 *
 *
 * @param  collection The collection to compute stats from. Any collection with color tokens as values will work.
 * @param options The optional overrides to customize the computing behaviour for the factors.
