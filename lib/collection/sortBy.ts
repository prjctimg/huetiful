/**
 * Sorts colors according to the specified `factor(s)`. The supported options are:
 *
 *
 * * The `factor` is expected to be an array of strings with each element being a valid `factor`. Every key is a `factor`, with the sorted collection as the value in the result object.
 *
 * To get all the factors in the result object pass `undefined` to `factor`.
 *
 *
 * * `'contrast'` - Sorts colors according to their contrast value as defined by WCAG.
 * The contrast is tested `against` a comparison color  which can be specified in the `options` object.
 * * `'lightness'` - Sorts colors according to their lightness.
 * * `'chroma'` - Sorts colors according to the intensity of their `chroma` in the `colorspace` specified in the `options` object.
 * * `'distance'` - Sorts colors according to their distance.
 * The distance is computed from the `against` color token which is used for comparison for all the colors in the `collection`.
 * * `luminance` - Sorts colors according to their relative brightness as defined by the WCAG3 definition.
 *
 * The return type is determined by the type of `collection`:
 *
 * * Plain objects are returned as `Map` objects because they remember insertion order. `Map` objects are returned as is.
 * * `ArrayLike` objects are returned as plain arrays. Plain arrays are returned as is.
 *
 * @param collection The `collection` of colors to sort. Any object with enumerable keys and color tokens as values will work. 
 * @param  options The optional overrides to customize the sorting behaviour.
 * @example
