# Contributing ðŸ’™

Thank you :smile: for contributing to [huetiful-js](https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful)!

On this page you'll find information on how to setup the project and navigate the file structure.

The project structure is as follows:

- `www/` - Where the documentation site lives 
- `lib/` - This is where the source code is located
- `tests/`  This is where the test  files for the publicly accessible symbols live.
## Requirements
#
- Supported version of Node (LTS or higher)
- Git
- Bun (for testing)
## Setupâ›³

To quickly get the development environment ready you can run  the following command, you can replace `npm` with any package manager :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prjctimg/huetiful && cd huetiful 

# Package manager of your choice
npm i -D
``` 
## Documentation

The API documentation is written as  JSDoc comments and is compiled from the source files using [TypeDoc][typedoc] and  [typedoc-plugin-markdown][markdown-plugin].

The site is generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

You can edit the other pages by going to the `www/docs/` directory.

## Adding/Running tests  ðŸ§ª

The project uses `bun:test` for unit testing. In order to run and create tests you need to have a working version of `bun` installed.

```sh
bun test

```
Each module with publicly exported symbols has a corresponding `*.test.ts` file. The specs are defined as an object with the following structure:
```ts
export type Spec = {
  description?: string;

  matcher?: string;
  callback: any;
  params: any[];
  result: any;
};
```
and then iterated using a helper function, `run` which takes an array of the `Spec` objects as its only parameter.
