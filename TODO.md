// This module is focused on creating color blind safe palettes that adhere to the minimum contrast requirements
// How can I achieve this ?
// 1. First I pass the color(s) to a color vision deficiency simulation function
// 2. Check if the color has the minimum required contrast as compared to a dark/light mode surface which can optionally be overriden
// 3. Check the min luminance contrast ratio between the color and background.
// 4. Find out which channels do I need to tweak in order to fix up the colors.
// 5. Maybe provide an optional adaptive boolean which returns dark/light mode variant colors of the color blind safe palettes.
// Add reference to articles
// Read more about the minimum accepted values for palette accessibility\

// Things I need to understand first:
// 1. What is adaptive color exactly
// -> Adaptive color is meant to adjust to luminance changes in the surrounding colors (or simply background)

// 2. What makes color adaptive
// -> Being able to look perceptually similar between different themes or backgrounds. For example a certain color looks over saturated in a dark theme. We can change the color's luminance to compensate for this shortfall whilst maintaining the hue and saturation constraints in our design system.

// 3. What is contrast and how does it affect adaptive color
// -> Contrast is the perceived difference in color i.e the ability of one color to stand out from another. This allows colors to be legible on different backgrounds.

// 4. What are the specifics of contrast ratio in relation to design elements
// -> Contrast ratios allow us to define the contrast relationship between the colors we're working with. For example certain text must meet a minimum contrast ratio in order for it to be easily viewable to a wider audience.

// 5. What are the nuances of dark/light mode. How is the color corrected when we switch themes
// -> Certain colors will diverge from our color system if we tune them up. For example yellow will turn dark yellow/{muddy} if we adjust it to meet WCAG requirements in light mode. Therefore such colors cannot be used for text.

// 6. How can this be implemented in code

// Providing a min luminance contrast ratio between text and background.
//

// adaptive returns an object of the adjusted colors
// {lightMode/darkMode:Color[]}

// Possible params
// 1. backgroundColor -> The backgroundColor to compare against
// 2. colors -> The colors to tune
// 3. viewingConditions

// First I need to declare some constants to serve as starting points
////// Approach was adapted from Adobe's Leonardo tool

/////// Rough concept of adaptive color

// Dark theme factors to consider
// 1. if color is darker than background. It means that color is not legible and will be tuned up
// 2. if color is lighter than background. it means its legible

// Light theme factors to consider
// 1. if a color is lighter than background. This means color is not compliant and will be fixed up.
// 2. if a color is darker than background. It means its legible

// Constants
// - baseluminance
// - colorluminance

// Find contrast colors
// find contrast color pairs that are harmonius

//  we think of chromatic adaption

// The relative luminance returned should be compliant to the defined ratio

// Purkinje Effect -> The peak sensitivity of the human eye shifts
// toward the blue end of the spectrum at lower light {luminance ?} levels.

// /**
//  *
//  * @param {*} color
//  * @param { AdaptivePaletteOptions} options
//  */
// function adaptive(color, options) {
//   var min_c,
//     par = 0.5;
// }

// export { adaptive };

//function adaptive(color, options = undefined) {}
