>  â€œRemember that your ruling reason becomes unconquerable when it rallies and relies on itself, so that it wonâ€™t do anything contrary to its own will, even if its position is irrational. How much more unconquerable if its judgments are careful and made rationally? Therefore, the mind freed from passions is an impenetrable fortressâ€”a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time.
