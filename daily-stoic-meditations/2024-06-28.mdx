>  “How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about people, it’s best to take a bird’seye view and see everything all at once—of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign people, holidays, memorials, markets—all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites.”
