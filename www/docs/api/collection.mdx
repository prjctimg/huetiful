## Functions

### distribute()

> **distribute**\<`Iterable`, `Options`\>(`collection`, `options`?): `Collection`

Distributes the specified `factor` of a color in the collection with the specified `extremum` (i.e the color with the smallest/largest `hue` angle or `chroma` value) to all color tokens in the collection.

#### Type Parameters

• **Iterable** *extends* `Collection`

• **Options** *extends* `DistributionOptions`

#### Parameters

• **collection**: `Iterable`

• **options?**: `Options`

#### Returns

`Collection`

### filterBy()

> **filterBy**\<`Iterable`, `Options`\>(`collection`, `options`): `Collection`

Filters a collection of colors using the specified `factor` as the criterion. The supported options are:
* `'contrast'` - Returns colors with the specified contrast range. The contrast is tested against a comparison color (the 'against' param) and the specified contrast ranges.
* `'lightness'` - Returns colors in the specified lightness range.
* `'chroma'` - Returns colors in the specified `saturation` or `chroma` range. The range is internally normalized to the supported ranges by the `colorspace` in use if it is out of range.

* `'distance'` - Returns colors with the specified `distance` range. The `distance` is tested against a comparison color (the 'against' param) and the specified `distance` ranges. Uses the `differenceHyab` metric for calculating the distances.
* `luminance` - Returns colors in the specified luminance range.
* `'hue'` - Returns colors in the specified hue ranges between 0 to 360.

:::tip
For the `chroma` and `lightness` factors, the range is internally normalized to the supported ranges by the `colorspace` in use if it is out of range. 
This means a value in the range `[0,1]` will return, for example if you pass `startLightness` as `0.3` it means `0.3 (or 30%)` of the channel's supported range. 
But if the value of either start or end is above 1 AND the `colorspace` in use has an end range higher than 1 then the value is treated as is else the value is treated as if in the range `[0,100]` and will return the normalized value.

#### Type Parameters

• **Iterable** *extends* `Collection`

• **Options** *extends* `FilterByOptions`

#### Parameters

• **collection**: `Iterable`

The collection of colors to filter.

• **options**: `Options`

#### Returns

`Collection`

#### See

https://culorijs.org/color-spaces/ For the expected ranges per colorspace.
Supports expression strings e.g `'>=0.5'`. The supported symbols are `== | === | != | !== | >= | <= | < | >`

#### Example

```ts
import { filterBy } from 'huetiful-js'

let sample = [
 '#00ffdc',
 '#00ff78',
 '#00c000',
 '#007e00',
 '#164100',
 '#ffff00',
 '#310000',
 '#3e0000',
 '#4e0000',
 '#600000',
 '#720000',
]
```

### sortBy()

> **sortBy**\<`Iterable`, `Options`\>(`collection`, `options`?): `Collection`

Sorts colors according to the specified `factor`. The supported options are:

* `'contrast'` - Sorts colors according to their contrast value as defined by WCAG.
The contrast is tested `against` a comparison color  which can be specified in the `options` object.
* `'lightness'` - Sorts colors according to their lightness.
* `'chroma'` - Sorts colors according to the intensity of their `chroma` in the `colorspace` specified in the `options` object.
* `'distance'` - Sorts colors according to their distance.
The distance is computed from the `against` color token which is used for comparison for all the colors in the `collection`.
* `luminance` - Sorts colors according to their relative brightness as defined by the WCAG3 definition.
:::tip
The return type is determined by the type of `collection`:

* Plain objects are returned as `Map` objects because they remember insertion order. `Map` objects are returned as is.
* `ArrayLike` objects are returned as plain arrays. Plain arrays are returned as is.

#### Type Parameters

• **Iterable** *extends* `Collection`

• **Options** *extends* `SortByOptions`

#### Parameters

• **collection**: `Iterable`

The `collection` of colors to sort.

• **options?**: `Options`

#### Returns

`Collection`

#### Example

```ts
import { sortBy } from 'huetiful-js'

let sample = ['purple', 'green', 'red', 'brown']
console.log(
 sortBy(sample,{ against:'yellow' kind:'distance',order:'desc',})
)

// [ 'brown', 'red', 'green', 'purple' ]
```

### stats()

> **stats**\<`Iterable`, `Options`\>(`collection`, `options`): \{\}

Computes statistical values about the passed in color collection.

The properties from each returned `factor` object are:

* `against` - The color being used for comparison.

Required for the `distance` and `contrast` factors.
If `relativeMean` is `false`, other factors that take the comparison color token as an overload will have this property's value as `null`.
* `colorspace` - The colorspace in which the factors were computed in. It has no effect on the `contrast` or `distance` factors (for now).

* `extremums` - An array of the minimum and the maximum value (respectively) of the `factor`.
* `colors` - An array of color tokens that have the minimum and maximum `extremum` values respectively.
* `mean` - The average value for the `factor`.

:::tip
The `mean` property can be overloaded by the `relativeMean` option:

* If `relativeMean` is `true`, the `against` option will be used as a subtrahend for calculating the distance between each `extremum`.
For example, it will mean "Get the largest/smallest distance between `factor` as compared `against` this color token otherwise just get the smallest/largest `factor` from thr passed in collection."

:::

These properties are available at the topmost level of the resultant object:

* `achromatic` - The amount of colors which are gray out of the total colors in the collection as a value in the range [0,1].
* `colorspace` - The colorspace in which the values were computed from, expected to be hue based.
Defaults to `lch` if an invalid mode like `rgb` is used.

#### Type Parameters

• **Iterable** *extends* `Collection`

• **Options** *extends* `StatsOptions`

#### Parameters

• **collection**: `Iterable`

The collection to compute stats from. Any collection with color tokens as values will work.

• **options**: `Options`

#### Returns

\{\}
